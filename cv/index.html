  <li><strong>GitHub</strong>: <a href="www.github.com/raulavila">www.github.com/raulavila</a>. It basically contains challenges, projects where I experiment with technologies and code that I comment on my blog. You can have a good idea of my programming style, even though, due to the nature of these projects, most of them don’t have a good test coverage</li>
  <li>Regular attendee to events and talks in London Software Craftmanship Community and London Java Community. I even delivered one lightning talk in the LSCC (16/7/15, slides: <a href="http://bit.ly/1e3t3xe">http://bit.ly/1e3t3xe</a>)</li>
